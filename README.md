## Labs Completed

- **AWS:**  
  - IAM policy creation and management  
  - S3 bucket security and permissions  
  - KMS encryption key management  
  - CloudTrail setup and log analysis  
  - GuardDuty threat detection  
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF) configuration  

- **Azure:**  
  - Identity and Conditional Access policies  
  - Network Security Groups (NSGs) configuration  
  - Defender for Cloud monitoring  
  - Azure Sentinel for security alerting and automation  

- **GCP:**  
  - IAM permissions management  
  - Security Command Center usage for risk assessment

## Mini Project

- Developed a secure AWS web application leveraging EC2 instances and S3 storage with strict IAM roles.  
- Implemented comprehensive logging and monitoring via CloudTrail and GuardDuty.  
- Configured WAF to protect against common web threats.  
- Simulated common misconfigurations such as publicly accessible S3 buckets and overly permissive IAM roles, and documented remediation steps.  
- All project code, configurations, and documentation are available in this repository.

## Additional Learning

- Completed TryHackMe Cloud Path labs focusing on:  
  - IAM exploitation techniques  
  - Metadata abuse  
  - S3 access misconfigurations
